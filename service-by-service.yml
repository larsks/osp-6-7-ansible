# # Service-by-service upgrade from RHEL-OSP 6 to RHEL-OSP 7
#
# This collection of playbooks demonstrates a process to upgrade a
# RHEL-OSP 6 environment to RHEL-OSP 7 with minimal downtime.  This
# playbook includes a suite of other playbooks to upgrade the
# individual services.  Individual playbooks include their own
# documentation.
#
# **NB**: For this procedure to work, you need RHEL-OSP 6 Neutron
# packages that have a fix for [BZ 1250056][].
